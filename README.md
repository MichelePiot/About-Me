# Hey there, I'm Michele.

**I believe good design comes from more than just design.**

I am a user experience designer and user researcher with a background in psychology. By combining a psychological background we can begin to understand those around us, what drives us, and how to implement what makes us human into good design. 

Design then collaborates with empathy, understanding, and a sense of putting ourselves in others' shoes. It becomes more than just design; it becomes a story, a journey, and an experience. 

## Design Process

When I identify the desired outcome I can begin to gain insight and perspective allowing myself to empathize with users. 

Research and development allow me to identify both pain and pleasure points, areas of frustration, and shows how users may really be feeling. 

Ideation pulls together the insight and research from users to spark creativity and begin the initial stages of design; piecing together what users might need in an easy to use way. 

Prototyping puts the creativity into action. Here I can delve deeper into our users and evaluate if the design meets our researched user needs. Evaluation is where I can gather feedback about prototypes and determine if the design is on the right track. 

Implementation is the big bow I wrap around the project. Here I take all Ive gathered and learned from our users; the cretivity, the empathy, the research is put together to create not only just a design but an experience to remember.
